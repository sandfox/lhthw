Robots. Usually the at the center of epic science fiction adventures whether
they are the deadly T-1000 from The Terminator or the fun and friendly WALL-E.
The first written accounts of 'robots' were from the 3rd century BC in ancient
China. It wasn't until after the 1950s that computers and robotics became
rapidly increasing in complexity and numbers. Fast forwarding to the present
day we have robots like ASIMO and amazing quadrotor robots.

People eventually began moving the concept of a robot to the virtual world on
the Internet. Internet Relay Chat, or IRC as it is more commonly known is a
protocol that allows people to join servers and channels to chat over the
Internet with other users. People created IRC bots which would join IRC and
appear to be a normal user, however they usually have built in artificial
intelligence and respond to various 'commands' issued by other users on IRC.
The oldest known IRC bots were Bill Wisher's Bartender and Greg Lindahl's GM
(Game Manager for the Hunt the Wumpus game).

Other methods of communicating online became available ranging from AOL
Instant Messenger to ICQ and to more recently 37signal's Campfire and HipChat.
Many 'bots' have been written for these services offering functionality such
as:

* Logging messages from chat
* Hosting trivia games
* Automating administrative tasks
* And more recently... sticking moustaches on random images

You may or may not have heard of GitHub. They offer online git repository
hosting with some nice features. GitHub employees are known for working
asynchronously and are spread all over the world. They use Campfire for
communicating with each other. At one of the GitHub summits, Ryan Tomayko
created the first hubot. It originally allowed employees to run commands on a
number of servers. Hubot became infamous after teasing much from many GitHub
employees in their presentations.

Fast forward to the present day and GitHub have since open sourced hubot and
allowed the public to help and contribute to hubot. I contributed a number of
fixes and scripts to hubot and hubot-scripts and eventually was asked if I
would like to help with maintaining hubot and hubot-scripts.

And on that note it's time to get on with the show and learn hubot the hard
way.
