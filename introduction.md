Learn Hubot the Hard Way is a short book written to help new and existing users
install, configure and even contribute back to hubot and hubot-scripts. You'll
also learn how the internals work in hubot itself.

Before reading this book you should be able to use and navigate a UNIX system,
and use tools such as git and rubygems. The later chapters will require you to
have an understanding of Node.js and CoffeeScript.
