# Prerequisites

To follow this book you're going to need access to a Linux, BSD or OS X
machine. This can be an actual machine or a virtual machine. You will also need
the following installed on the system to deploy and configure hubot.

* Node.js (0.4.x or 0.6.x with npm installed)
* Ruby (1.8.7 or 1.9 with rubygems installed) if you wish to deploy to Heroku

You must be comfortable navigating and using the system from a terminal and
know the basic UNIX commands.

The later chapters of the book are going to require you to at least have an
understanding of Node.js and JavaScript. Hubot is written in CoffeeScript and
the scripts as well, however CoffeeScript is fairly simple to pick up.
